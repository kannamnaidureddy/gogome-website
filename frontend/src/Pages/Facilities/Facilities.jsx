      <h1>Introduction</h1> <br/>
      I was in college the first time I heard the phrase quiet time from a Christian peer. I was too embarrassed to ask what that meant, especially as I saw my other Christian friends all nod in understanding.

      Luckily I was observant enough to pick up on the context clues.

      Simply put, quiet time is dedicated time with God. This can be just prayer, but it often includes a devotion, a Bible study, or both.
      <br/>

      <h1>Few more point I learnt Today's Quiet Time</h1>
      <br/>
      <ul>
        <li>Primary expectation from God for me is that the Kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. I need and want to serve Christ in a way that is pleasing to God and receives human approval.</li>
        <br/>
        <li>Each food is clean. I need to My food habits check myself. Do I destroy the word of God for the sake of it or not? And is it wrong for a person to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble or not? If I stumble about eating anything, God told me that it is better not to eat food or drink anything or do anything else that will cause my brothers or sisters to fall.  </li>

      </ul>
      <br/>
      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>Whatever I eat or drink, whether it hurts anyone or not, ultimately, I strive to do what leads to peace, mutual edification, and is pleasing to God.</p>
